Chart Review Tool Powered by NLP (CHANL)
The Chart Review Tool Powered by NLP (CHANL) aims to enhance the efficiency of reviewing narrative text notes extracted from electronic medical records (EMR). Its capabilities extend beyond conducting simultaneous intelligent searches for various topics of interest; it also autonomously identifies related terms and concepts within the notes. The interface emphasizes pertinent information within the notes, simplifying the retrieval of essential data. Users currently attest to notable enhancements in the efficiency and precision of chart reviews. CHANL was developed by Dr. Tianrun Cai, a faculty member of the VERITY Bioinformatics Core team.![image](https://github.com/TianrunCai/CHANL/assets/22990463/68aa01ab-ca46-4e8f-a4af-fd42b0772eae)
